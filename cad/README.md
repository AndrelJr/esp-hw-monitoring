PC MONITORUNG CAD
==========

Enclosure in 3mm acrylic. 

It was made with [LCInterlocking](https://github.com/execuc/LCInterlocking) FreeCAD module. It allow to design parts in 3D with 
interlocking. Then parts are projected on plane in order to export in SVG file.

The enclosure is designed to use M2 screw and nuts :
 * Screws : 4xM2*16mm M2*10mm , M2*6mm
 * Spacers female/female : M2*30mm
 * Spaces Male/femele : M2*6mm

 
LCInterlocking parameters are :
 * Laser kerf : 0.21mm
 * Thickness tolerance : +/- 0.5mm
 * Width tolerance : 0.5mm
 
There are three files :
 * temperature.fcstd : FreeCAD without interlocking.
 * temperature_join.fcstd : FreeCAD with interlocking.
 * temperature.svg : file to laser cut.
